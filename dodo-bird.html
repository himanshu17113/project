        <h1>Dodo Bird</h1>
        <p>Dodo, belonging to the family Columbidae, was a flightless bird endemic to the island of Mauritius. The first
            recorded mention of this bird came from Dutch sailors in 1598. Dodo was considered by many as being mythical
            creatures.</p>

            <p>The appearance of this species is known from the 17th century written accounts, paintings and drawings.
                With
                varying
                hypothesis, its exact appearance still stays unsolved to an extent. There are very few illustrations
                that
                have been
                drawn from live specimens. Widely accepted views suggest that they had brownish-grey plumage; grey,
                naked
                head; a
                tuft of tail feathers; yellow feet and a black, yellow, and green beak.</p>

            <p>Early scientists described this bird as a small ostrich, an albatross, a rail and even a vulture. In
                1842,
                Danish
                zoologist and herpetologist Johannes Theodor Reinhardt was the first to describe this species as ‘ground
                pigeons.’
                He came to the conclusion after researching dodo skulls from the Royal Danish collection at Copenhagen.
                His
                views
                were later supported by Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville in their paper ‘The Dodo and
                Its
                Kindred’ in 1848.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>



        <p>Dodos were less aggressive than Rodrigues solitaire and intraspecific battles were quite rare. They used
            their beak
            for defense.</p>

            <p>Dodo, endemic to Mauritius, inhabited forests in the drier coastal regions of south and west of the
                island. A
                little
                population also inhabited mountain regions. Their habitat was dominated by Pandanus and tambalacoque
                trees
                as well
                as endemic plants.</p>

        </div>


        <h2>Reproduction</h2>



        <p>Dodos were monogamous. It has been suggested that mating ritual included ‘clapping’ with their ‘hand.’ With
            no
            predators around, they nested on the ground. They laid a one-egg clutch. The egg was hatched after 46 days.
            Both
            male and female took part in taking care of the young.</p>

            <p>Hunting (for meat) is the primary cause of its extinction, which went unnoticed for some time. They were
                killed in
                thousands by sailors (sometimes killed as many as fifty at a time). Their eggs and chicks were also easy
                prey to the
                animals introduced to the island by the sailors.</p>

        <p>It had also been suggested that the Dodo population might have been low even before humans arrived. If they
            had
            occupied remote places in the island, then their extinction could not have been that rapid.</p>



        <p>Their exact extinction timeline is not known, but most widely accepted date is 1662. The last claimed
            sighting came
            from Isaac Johannes Lamotius&#8217; hunting records in 1688.</p>



        <h2>Etemology</h2>



        <p>The etymology of the word ‘dodo’ is not known. However, it is believed that it came from Dutch word ‘dodoor’
            which
            means ‘sluggard.’ Dodo was referred to as ‘Walghvogel’ in Vice Admiral Wybrand van Warwijck’s journal. In
            Dutch
            ‘walghe’ means ‘insipid’ and ‘vogel’ means ‘bird.’</p>

                    flightless.</li>
                <li>Scientists have thought of cloning by extracting its DNA and using a closest relative species as a
                    mother, but
                    that would not produce a perfect dodo as its genetic code survives in tiny fragments, and most
                    likely,
                    it would
                    not be possible to work that out with perfect accuracy.</li>
                <li>The traditional image of this bird being fat and clumsy might be wrongly depicted. Based on crudely
                    stuffed
                    specimens, scientists have suggested that the images with puffed feathers is a part of their display
                    behavior.

                <li>A white dodo was incorrectly thought to have inhabited the island of Réunion.</li>
                <li>Skeleton and other specimens related to this bird can be found in Oxford University Museum of
                    Natural
                    History,
                    British Museum in London as well as several museums throughout Europe, America and Mauritius.</li>

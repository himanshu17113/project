                    <p>Smilodons were ancient big cats that are popularly known as the ‘saber-toothed cat’. This is a
                        genus under which three extinct species have been recognized – the <em>S. populator</em>, the
                        <em>S. fatalis</em>, and the <em>S. gracilis</em>. The first evidence of their existence was
                        found from fossils unearthed in the second quarter of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">In 1830, the fossil of the <em>Smilodon populator</em>, a
                            species of the genus Smilodon, was the
                            first to be discovered and described in Brazil by Danish paleontologist, zoologist, and
                            archeologist Peter Wilhelm Lund. In 1842, he named the genus as ‘Smilodon’. <br> Since the
                            discovery of the first species, other members of the genus began to be documented as
                            well. In 1869, the fossil of <em>Smilodon fatalis</em> was unearthed in North America by the
                            team led by American paleontologist Joseph Leidy. In around a decade, in 1880, the remains
                            of
                            the third species, <em>Smilodon gracilis</em>, was discovered by American paleontologist and
                            comparative anatomist Edward Drinker Cope. These prehistoric animals were distributed from
                            Eurasia to North and South America. Out of the three, the <em>S. fatalis</em> is probably
                            the
                            most well-known species in North America. The creature was abundantly found in California’s
                            Rancho La Brea tar pits.</p>

                    </div>



                    <p>Since their discoveries, the scientists were able to place the entire genus in relation to modern
                        day fauna by phylogenetic analysis, though nothing much other than a handful of information
                        about these animals could be retrieved from their remains. Like all the cats (big and small),
                        the Smilodons too belonged to the family <em>Felidae</em>, falling under the order
                        <em>Carnivora</em>.
                    </p>



                    <p>Early DNA analysis placed these creatures within the subfamily <em>Felinae</em>, standard with
                        the modern-day cats. However, recently, more in-depth analysis of the subject revealed that the
                        Smilodons were not a close cousin of the felines (<em>Felinae</em>). They are rather members of
                        a subfamily <em>Machairodontinae</em>, which evolved extant of the <em>Felinae</em> types.</p>

                    </div>




                    <p>Compared to its phylogeny, the history of the evolution of Smilodons was rather easier to study.
                        The initial fossil that was unearthed, belonged to the <em>S. gracilis </em>that evolved around
                        2.5 million years ago during the Pleistocene Epoch. The second, <em>S. fatalis</em>, developed
                        approximately 1.6 million years ago, while the evolution of the final one, <em>S.
                            populator</em>, was about 1 million years ago.</p>

                    <p>Smilodons had a very massive size, with the <em>Smilodon populator </em>being the heaviest of all
                        the three species, weighing more than 800 pounds. <em>Smilodon fatalis</em> was almost the same
                        size as a modern-day lion, but slightly heavier. They were approximately 430-600 pounds.
                        <em>Smilodon gracilis</em> was the smallest of the three thought to be about the size of a
                        jaguar, weighing around 360 pounds.

                    </div>



                    <p>The most distinctive features of Smilodons are their pair of large upper canine teeth that was
                        around 28 cm long in <em>S. populator</em>, giving them the colloquial name ‘saber-toothed
                        cats’. Out of the two types of such cats, viz. the short, broad-canine ‘scimitar-toothed’, and
                        the longer, slender-canine ‘dirk-toothed’, the smilodons fall under the latter type.</p>



                    <p>Smilodons had the ability to open their jaws very widely at an angle of about 100° with the rest
                        of their skull/head. Coat features like lion’s mane or tiger’s stripes are too unusual to
                        predict from fossil remains; however, they possibly had either plain-colored coats or a spotted
                        one.</p>

                        <p>There is very little evidence and quite a lot of debate among researchers about the exact
                            behavior of this genus and its related species. However, like all felines, the Smilodon was
                            also
                            a carnivore, the biggest evidence of which is its pair of large and characteristic canine
                            teeth.
                        </p>



                        <p>Scientists also presume that they were ambush predators since they had stout, muscular
                            forelimbs.
                            They are thought to have been suddenly attacking and surprising their prey by sneaking up on
                            them and kill them quickly. However, other groups of scientists debate upon this behavior.
                            Since
                            these large cats had physical resemblance with hyenas, they believe that the animals had the
                            ability to chase prey over considerable distances, at least for some time.</p>

                    <p>The creatures probably preferred large herbivores as prey. The density of their population
                        discovered in the Rancho La Brea tar pits suggests that the Smilodons might have been hunting in
                        packs in order to take down such large-size prey.</p>



                    <p>However, the most mysterious part that intrigued the scientists is how these cats would use their
                        oversized teeth. While some paleontologists believe that they utilized them like a knife,
                        sinking the teeth into the flesh of the prey, others think, they would use the teeth to slice
                        meat off from the carcasses of animals already dead. This, in turn, implies that they might have
                        been scavengers as well. However, because their teeth were quite fragile, their owners were not
                        able to consume the entire prey since they might then damage them.</p>



                    <h2>Diet: What did they Eat</h2>



                    <p>The size of all the teeth of the smilodon and the robustness of the skeleton suggest that their
                        prey included large mammals like bison, horses, camels, giant ground sloths, and probably young
                        mammoths and mastodonts.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The name ‘Smilodon’ has nothing to do with ‘toothy smile’, but came from Ancient Greek
                                words
                                <em>smilē</em>, which is a ‘scalpel’ or a ‘two-edged knife’, and <em>odontús</em>,
                                meaning
                                ‘tooth’.
                            </li>
                            <li>It is still not clear as to how these animals faced extinction. Several extinction
                                theories
                                believe in different reasons including climate change, possible competition with humans
                                (however, there is no evidence in favor), or for the extinction of large animals it
                                preyed
                                upon.</li>
                            <li>Though the smilodons closely resembled the modern-day tigers, they were not close
                                relatives.
                            </li>
                            <li>The primary enemies of the smilodons were hyenas and dire wolves that shared a common
                                habitat with them.</li>
                            <li>Smilodon was the heaviest-built of all machairodontine cats (an extinct subfamily of
                                carnivorous mammals from the family of ‘true cats’).</li>

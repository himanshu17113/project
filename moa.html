        <h1>Moa</h1>
        <p>The Moa, also known as the Giant Moa, was a genus of large-size birds that were endemic to the island nation
            of New
            Zealand several centuries back. These flightless birds, which existed in nine species under six genera,
            lived in the
            country for several thousand years before the Māori colonists settled in the country in around 1300 AD. In
            recent
            years, efforts have been undertaken by scientists for the revival of this extinct creature.</p>













        <h2> History of Extinction</h2>

            <p>Paleontologists estimated that there was a population of about 58,000 moas during the time the indigenous
                Polynesians
                settled in New Zealand in around 1280. The moas had gone extinct 300 years prior to the arrival of the
                European
                settlers.</p>



            <p>Soon after the arrival of the Māoris, the entire genera of the bird were soon taken to extinction by
                means of
                regular
                hunting. The colonists hunted the moas by driving them into pits, as also, robbing their nests. They
                were
                killed for
                food.</p>

                <figcaption>Giant Moa Bird</figcaption>
            </figure>




            <p>Another reason for their extinction was loss of habitat, to some extent. As the Māoris entered the then
                New
                Zealand
                for the first time, they needed miles of land for making houses and farming. The new inhabitants began
                clearing the
                jungles that practically covered the entire island. With the rapid increase in human population, the
                inhabitants
                began clearing the woods, eventually leading to their habitat loss.</p>



            <p>Finally, by 1445, all moa went into extinction, along with the enormous Haast&#8217;s eagle, which was
                the
                primary
                predator of the moa birds and relied on the latter for survival.</p>



            <p>Recently, research on their extinction using carbon-14 dating strongly suggests that the incidents and
                causes
                leading
                to the disappearance of these giant birds took less than a century, rather than a long time period of
                their
                exploitation lasting a few centuries that was previously hypothesized.</p>

        <h2> Discovery of Moa Remains</h2>



        <div class="left">
            <figure> <img decoding="async"

                <figcaption>Moa Bird</figcaption>
            </figure>




            <p>From the mid-1860s to the 1980s, several amazing specimens of moa remains have been found in the
                semi-arid
                region of
                Central Otago, the aridest region of New Zealand. These specimens, exhibiting soft tissues like muscle,
                skin, and
                feathers, were mostly preserved through desiccation when the moa died in a naturally dry site (e.g., a
                cave
                with a
                dry wind blowing constantly through it).</p>



            <p>Some of the discovered specimens include dried muscle on bones, an articulated foot, several fragmented
                bones, a
                lower leg along with skin and muscle, an entire feathered leg, a head, etc.</p>

            </figure>




            <p>These specimens are now preserved in different museums in New Zealand, like the Museum of New Zealand,
                Otago
                Museum,
                as also in London&#8217;s Cambridge University (Zoology Department), Natural History Museum, Yorkshire
                Museum, etc.
            </p>



            <p>There has been occasional speculation and claims of moa survival since at least the late 19th century,
                and as
                recently as 1993 and 2008; however, there was no supporting evidence in support of these claims.</p>



            <h2>Attempts for Revival of the Moa</h2>



            <p>The genera has been mentioned frequently as a potential candidate for revival by means of genetic
                cloning.
                Presently,
                a Japanese geneticist Ankoh Yasuyuki Shirota has undertaken a primary work relating to the
                extraction of DNA
                of this
                bird.</p>

            <p>Thirty-six complete eggs of different species of moa, which have now been collected by the
                museums, differ
                greatly in
                size, starting from 120–240 mm (4.7–9.4 in) in length and 91–178 mm (3.6–7.0 in) in width. The
                specific
                length and
                other features largely varied between the different moa species; however, it is clear that all
                the moa bird
                species
                largely resembled the emus and ostriches. Their feathers were large and up to 23 cm (9 in) long.
            </p>



            <p>Reportedly, the feathers bore a wide range of colors including white, reddish-brown, purplish and
                yellowish.
                Dark
                feathers having creamy to white tips have also been discovered, indicating that some species of
                moa might
                have had
                plumage that had a dappled appearance.</p>

        </h2> Behavior &amp; Diet
        </h2>



        <p>Moas were primarily solitary birds that lived in the regions with dense to mixed vegetation.
            Morphological
            analysis
            of skull and beak, fossilized contents of the gizzards, as well as stable isotope analysis
            of the bones,
            &nbsp;suggested that these birds were herbivores, and fed on a wide variety of plant species
            and plant
            matters,
            including leaves and fibrous twigs collected from shrubs and low-lying trees.</p>

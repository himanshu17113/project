            The Irish Elk, belonging to family Cervidae, is an extinct mammal. In contrary to its name, the
            Irish Elk was neither
            an Elk (belonging to the same group as North American Elk or the European Elk, which is popularly
            known as Moose in
            Northern America) nor it was exclusively found in or around Ireland. DNA evidence suggests that it
            was actually a
            deer species. In fact, it was one of the largest deer species that have ever roamed on earth. Reason
            that the word
            ‘Irish’ has struck with the name of this species because their skeleton remains were mainly found in
            the peat bogs
            and lake sediments in Ireland.</p>



        <p>In the past, phylogenetic research suggested the idea of a sister-group relationship between
            Irish Elk and Fallow
            Deer. But new morphological analysis has proved that the Irish Elk is more closely related to
            Red Deer.</p>



        <p>This species thrived during a period known as Woodgrange Interstadial in Irish palaeoecology.
            They went extinct
            around 10000 years ago with Giant sloths and Sabre-tooth cats. Scientists believe that they
            lived for around 2000
            years in and around Siberia even after it was believed to have gone extinct.</p>

            <p ">Their native range included Europe and northern Asia – from Ireland in
                            the west to as far as
                            Lake
                            Baikal in the east.
                            They were also found in some parts in northern Africa. A related form is known to inhabit
                            China
                            during Late
                            Pleistocene. </p></div>  
                  

 
      <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
 
                  



                    <p>Scientists, in their first description of this species, greatly confused it with the American
                        Moose, while some other
                        scientists thought that they were identical with the European reindeer. French naturalist
                        Georges Cuvier first
                        identified this species as totally different from North American Elk or Moose. His study of this
                        species paved a way
                        to understand the taxonomy of this species.</p>

            <p>Megaloceros giganteus evolved throughout the Glacial periods – mainly during the
                Pleistocene
                Epoch. Structurally,
                they are considered as the heaviest known member of the ‘Old World deer’ (A division of
                the
                subfamily Cervinae
                &#8211; divided into ‘Old World deer’ and ‘New World deer’; and they are differentiated
                according to their foot
                structure instead of their geographical origin). Research works have shown that
                Megaloceros
                giganteus have evolved
                from M. antecedens.</p>

        <p>Researchers had given several theories when it came to the evolution of their antlers. They
            had
            antlers of suitable
            size in correlation to their massive body structure. It is believed that the antlers
            increased
            in size under strong
            and constant sexual selection.</p>



        <p>Males are known to use their antlers in combat with other male specimens. Some theory
            suggests
            that their horns were
            morphologically not well suited for battles. However, they were great for intimidating
            dominant
            rival males and
            attracting females. Stags are also known to shed their antlers during mating season.</p>



        <h2>Reproduction</h2>



        <div class="right">
            <figure> <img decoding="async" loading="lazy"
                    src="https://www.extinctanimals.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Irish-Elk-Images-300x202.jpg" alt=""

            </figure>
        </div>



        <p>The mating system of this species is not known. The sexual dimorphism via the antlers
            suggests
            intra-sexual combat,
            intra-sexual displays, large mating congregations and polygyny. In such a system, breeding
            should not be an issue
            irrespective of male/female ratio. Even if it is presumed that males with huge antlers died
            in
            an adverse
            environmental situation, it is very much possible that the presence of less dominant stags
            would
            have been perfectly
            suitable to deal with the mating void.</p>



        <h2>Extinction</h2>

        <p>Available evidence suggests that one cause could not have been wholly responsible for the
            extinction of Irish Elk. A
            variety of factors played significant roles in different parts of its native range in wiping
            out
            this species.</p>



        <p>Their antler size and sexual selection had always been the focus of discussion even when it
            came
            to the cause of
            their extinction. Fossil samples, collected from Ballybetagh bog, in Ireland, suggest that
            males
            and females went
            isolated from each other during winters. It suggests that they had behaviors such as
            polygynous
            and rutting mating
            systems. Recent studies suggest that the reproductive energetics of females could be a
            contributing factor in the
            elimination of this species.</p>

            </figure>




            <p>Another theory is habitat degradation that triggered a nutritional stress, mainly among
                males.
                Their adaptation to
                mineral metabolism (as high amounts of phosphate and calcium compounds are important to form
                antlers) in natural
                diet altered with the loss of habitat. But, the most recent fossil specimen, found in
                Siberia,
                dated around 7700
                years ago, showed no signs of nutrient-related problems in that part of its range.</p>



            <p>Scientists argue that several other factors like hunting by people, ecological change and
                virulent disease triggered
                its extinction, like it happened with other prehistoric megafauna.</p>
